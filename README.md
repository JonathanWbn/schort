# Schort

Just another URL shortener. Simple and fast.

Check it at: [schort.me](https://schort.me/)

### Motivation

I thought it would be fun to have my own URL shortener.
The good slugs are already gone at [bit.ly](https://bitly.com/) or [tinyurl.com](https://tinyurl.com/), so I get a fresh start here.

The name is a German take on "short", as in "short link".

### Stack
